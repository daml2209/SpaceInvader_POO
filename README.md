# Space Invaders - POO

The following project aimed to put into practice all the skills learned through my studies of python

### Prerequisites

In order to execute the game it will necesary to have **Python** and the next libraries:
 * os
 * time
 * random
 * pygame
 * mixer from the pygame library
 
### Scope

This project was made using **object-oriented programming** as and upgraded version from the last game of space invaders.

The game was made with the initial idea to put on practice all the knolowge adquire of python to this point. Such as, data structure, objects, functions, a few libraries, problem solve and code optimization.

The code can have some limitations but remember that all this was made just to create experience in coding and objects.

If you have and idea of how to upgrade this version, want to do some changes, or just want to play it, feel free to do it. I encourage you to do it!

In order to have music in the game you can put any track that you want in the sound folder with the name: background_music.mp3 (if you have another extension it will be necesary to change the code then)
